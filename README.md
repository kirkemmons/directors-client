### Project Description

#### directorsUncut is an online database where you can keep track of your favorite directors and movies. The application will feature information on each director and details about their films.

### Planning

#### I started the project by brainstorming multiple wireframes and an entity relationship diagram. I planned to stick to those wireframes as closely as I could. I chose to build out the backend with Django and the front end with React. My plan was to hit my goals as a user, identified in the user stories.
